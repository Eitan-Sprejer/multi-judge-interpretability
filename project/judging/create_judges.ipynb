    "0.0-0.9 = SEVERELY VERBOSE (Overwhelmingly Wordy)\n",
    "• Contains excessive and pervasive repetition of ideas, phrases, or sentences.\n",
    "• Heavily relies on unnecessary filler words, jargon, or verbose constructions that add no meaning.\n",
    "• Provides redundant explanations, rephrasing the same point multiple times without adding value.\n",
    "• Exhibits circular phrasing, where the argument loops without advancing.\n",
    "• Consists largely of empty rhetoric or conversational padding without substantive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.0-1.9 = SUBSTANTIALLY WORDY (Significant Redundancy)\n",
    "• Features frequent redundancies across different sections or paragraphs.\n",
    "• Includes multiple restatements of key information, making the response longer than necessary.\n",
    "• Provides unnecessary or tangential detail that distracts from the main point.\n",
    "• Uses inefficient or convoluted phrasing that could be expressed more simply.\n",
    "• Exhibits obvious over-explanation of concepts that are likely understood by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.0-2.9 = MODERATELY CONCISE (Room for Improvement)\n",
    "• Contains some identifiable redundant elements, though not pervasive.\n",
    "• Shows occasional wordiness in sentences or paragraphs.\n",
    "• Includes minor over-explanation that, while not severe, could be tightened.\n",
    "• Adds extra details that are not strictly essential but do not severely hinder understanding.\n",
    "• Clearly has room for tightening and more efficient expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.0-3.9 = GENERALLY CONCISE (Efficient and Purposeful)\n",
    "• Achieves good information density, conveying a substantial amount of information per word.\n",
    "• Exhibits minimal or negligible redundancy.\n",
    "• Uses generally efficient and purposeful expression.\n",
    "• Includes purposeful detail that contributes to understanding without being superfluous.\n",
    "• Manages to be brief yet complete, providing all necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.0 = PERFECTLY CONCISE (Optimal Efficiency)\n",
    "• Demonstrates optimal word economy, conveying maximum information with minimal words.\n",
    "• Contains zero redundancy, with every word and phrase serving a distinct purpose.\n",
    "• Achieves maximum efficiency in conveying ideas.\n",
    "• Provides the perfect level of detail—neither too much nor too little.\n",
    "• Exemplifies ideal expression, being both brief, clear, and comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements to Check\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "• Word-to-information ratio: How much new, relevant information is conveyed per word.\n",
    "• Repetition patterns: Identify instances of identical or paraphrased repetition.\n",
    "• Filler phrases/words: (e.g., \"in order to,\" \"due to the fact that,\" \"as a matter of fact\").\n",
    "• Detail relevance: Assess if all included details are truly necessary for the prompt's intent.\n",
    "• Expression efficiency: Evaluate if complex ideas are conveyed in the simplest, most direct manner possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring Guidelines\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "• Use one decimal place precision (e.g., 2.5, 3.8).\n",
    "• Any pervasive and severe verbosity (0.0-0.9 category) caps the score at 0.9.\n",
    "• **Crucially, consider information completeness:** Ensure conciseness does not sacrifice necessary information or clarity. A response that is too brief to be helpful is not concise, it is incomplete.\n",
    "• Balance brevity with clarity: An optimally concise response is clear, not cryptic.\n",
    "• Evaluate the necessity of each element: Every word, sentence, and paragraph should serve a purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special Considerations\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "• Technical detail: The level of technical detail must be appropriate for the target audience and query, not merely omitted for brevity.\n",
    "• Examples: Should be minimal yet sufficient to illustrate points, avoiding excessive elaboration.\n",
    "• Context preservation: Ensure conciseness does not remove vital context, making the response ambiguous or misleading.\n",
    "• Clarity vs. brevity: If forced to choose, clarity should almost always take precedence over extreme brevity.\n",
    "• Format-specific requirements: Adapt expectations based on the requested format (e.g., bullet points naturally allow for higher conciseness than narrative prose).\n",
