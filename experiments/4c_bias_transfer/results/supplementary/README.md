## Individual Judge Analysis

### Judge Bias Heatmap
- **File**: `20250814_144816_individual_judge_heatmap.png`
- **Description**: Heatmap showing framing and frequency bias levels for each individual judge
- **Purpose**: Identify which judges have the highest/lowest bias levels

### Judge Distribution Plots  
- **File**: `20250814_144816_individual_judge_distributions.png`
- **Description**: Bar charts showing bias distribution across individual judges
- **Purpose**: Compare individual judge performance and identify outliers

### Judge Ranking
- **File**: `20250814_144816_judge_ranking.png`
- **Description**: Horizontal bar chart ranking judges by combined bias score
- **Purpose**: Identify best and worst performing individual judges

## Method Comparison Details

### Performance Matrix
- **File**: `20250814_144816_performance_matrix.png`
- **Description**: Comprehensive 4-panel comparison of naive vs MLP performance
- **Purpose**: Detailed analysis of method effectiveness across multiple metrics

### Effectiveness Chart
- **File**: `20250814_144816_effectiveness_chart.png`
- **Description**: Bar chart comparing methods across effectiveness dimensions
- **Purpose**: Overall performance comparison with scoring system

## How to Use

These supplementary figures provide additional insights beyond the main clean report:

1. **Individual Judge Analysis** - Use to understand variability in judge performance and identify potential problematic judges
2. **Method Comparison Details** - Use for deeper analysis of why one method outperforms another

## Main Report Files

For the primary results, see the main results folder:
- `20250814_144816_COMPLETE_REPORT.json` - Full detailed report
- `20250814_144816_CLEAN_SUMMARY.md` - Clean summary report  
- `20250814_144816_bias_reduction_plots.png` - Main visualization

## Interpretation Notes

- **Lower bias values** = Better performance (less cognitive bias)
- **Higher reduction percentages** = Better bias mitigation
- **Negative reduction percentages** = Bias amplification (concerning)
