# Bias Robustness Pipeline - Experiment 1C

## Overview

This pipeline implements a systematic approach to testing the robustness of learned aggregation functions against systematic biases in judge scoring. Unlike traditional rubric variation approaches, this method applies direct mathematical transformations to judge scores to simulate various types of real-world bias conditions.

## Research Question

**Core Hypothesis**: Learned aggregation functions (GAM, MLP, Linear Regression) are fundamentally more robust to systematic biases than simple averaging (Judge Mean) when combining multiple judge evaluations.

## Methodological Innovation

### From Rubric Variations to Bias Transformations

**Previous Approach (Ineffective)**:
- Modify rubric text subtly for different judge variants
- Test single model on different rubric combinations
- Limited bias magnitude (±0.02-0.13 points on 0-4 scale)
- Uniform effects across all judges

**New Approach (Effective)**:
- Apply direct mathematical transformations to judge scores
- Train separate models under each bias condition  
- Parameterizable bias strength (0.0 to 1.0)
- Diverse transformation types targeting different failure modes

## Pipeline Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Foundation
```
Input: Original judge scores (1000 samples × 10 judges)
Source: experiments/1c_rubric_sensitivity/results_full_20250818_215910/restructured_scores_fixed.pkl
Ground Truth: Balanced persona sampling from human feedback
Format: 80/20 train/test split with consistent random seed (42)
```

### Phase 2: Bias Transformation Engine
```python
class BiasTransformer:
    @staticmethod
    def bottom_heavy(scores, strength):
        """Compresses high scores → power transformation"""
        power = 1 + strength * 3  
        return (scores / 4.0) ** power * 4.0
    
    @staticmethod 
    def top_heavy(scores, strength):
        """Compresses low scores → inverse power transformation"""
        inverted = 4.0 - scores
        transformed = BiasTransformer.bottom_heavy(inverted, strength)
        return 4.0 - transformed
    
    @staticmethod
    def middle_heavy(scores, strength):
        """Pulls extremes to center → variance compression"""
        center = 2.0
        deviation = scores - center
        return center + deviation * (1 - strength * 0.8)
    
    @staticmethod
    def systematic_shift(scores, strength):
        """Linear translation → distribution shift"""
        return np.clip(scores + strength * 1.0, 0, 4)
```

### Phase 3: Model Training & Evaluation
```python
def train_models(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):
    """Train all aggregator models and baseline."""
    
    # 1. GAM with proper PyGAM splines
    gam_model = GAMAggregator(n_splines=10, lam=0.6)
    gam_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # 2. MLP with early stopping
    mlp_model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(64,), early_stopping=True)
    mlp_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # 3. Linear Regression baseline
    lr_model = LinearRegression()
    lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # 4. Judge Mean with realistic scaling
    judge_mean_predictions = (np.mean(X_test, axis=1) / 4.0) * 10.0
    
    return evaluate_all_models()
```

### Phase 4: Robustness Analysis
```python
# Test across bias conditions
bias_experiments = {
    'bottom_heavy': np.linspace(0, 1.0, 6),
    'top_heavy': np.linspace(0, 1.0, 6), 
    'middle_heavy': np.linspace(0, 1.0, 6),
    'systematic_shift_positive': np.linspace(0, 1.0, 6),
    'systematic_shift_negative': np.linspace(0, 1.0, 6)
}

# Performance metrics: R² score across all conditions
# Robustness metrics: Performance degradation from baseline (strength=0)
```

## Key Experimental Validations

### 1. Proper GAM Implementation
**Critical Fix**: Using PyGAM with splines instead of Ridge regression
```python
# Before: Ridge regression (essentially linear)
gam_model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)

# After: Proper GAM with spline basis functions  
terms = sum([s(i, n_splines=10, lam=0.6) for i in range(X.shape[1])])
self.model = LinearGAM(terms)
```
**Result**: GAM now shows distinct non-linear modeling capabilities

### 2. Realistic Judge Mean Scaling
**Critical Fix**: Using realistic interval scaling instead of test set statistics
```python
# Before: Uses test set mean/std (unrealistic)
scaled = (raw - test_mean) * test_std + target_mean  

# After: Simple interval scaling (realistic)
scaled = (raw / 4.0) * 10.0  # 0-4 scale → 0-10 scale
```
**Result**: Judge Mean performance properly reflects real-world constraints

### 3. Systematic Bias Conditions
**Innovation**: 30 distinct robustness conditions (5 bias types × 6 strengths)
- **Diverse failure modes**: Non-linear compression, linear shifts, variance changes
- **Parameterizable intensity**: Gradual degradation curves from mild to extreme
- **Realistic modeling**: Simulates actual judge inconsistency patterns

## Results Summary

### Model Robustness Rankings
1. **Linear Regression**: Most robust across systematic shifts (R² ≈ 0.58)
2. **GAM (Splines)**: Consistent performance with non-linear adaptability (R² ≈ 0.56-0.58)  
3. **MLP**: Variable but generally robust (R² ≈ 0.39-0.58)
4. **Judge Mean**: Complete failure under 60% of bias conditions (R² negative)

### Critical Findings
- **Judge Mean Catastrophic Failure**: Goes negative (R² < 0) under non-linear bias
- **Learned Aggregator Resilience**: Maintain positive R² > 0.39 under all conditions
- **7.5x Performance Advantage**: Best case comparison under systematic shift
- **Consistent Robustness**: All learned methods outperform simple averaging
