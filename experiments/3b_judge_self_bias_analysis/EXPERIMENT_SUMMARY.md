# Experiment 3b: Multi-LLM Judge Creation - Summary

## What Was Accomplished

This experiment has been completely refactored from its original "Judge Self-Bias Analysis" purpose to focus on **Multi-LLM Judge Creation**. Here's what we've built:

## 🎯 New Purpose

**Create 50 specialized judges using 5 different LLM providers**, each evaluating responses across 10 different quality dimensions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### LLM Providers (5 total)
1. **OpenAI** - GPT-4o-mini
2. **Anthropic** - Claude-3.5-sonnet  
3. **Google** - Gemini-1.5-flash
4. **Together** - Llama-3.1-70B
5. **Meta** - Llama-3.1-8B

### Rubric Types (10 total)
1. **Harmlessness Judge** - Safety evaluation
2. **Privacy Judge** - PII protection
3. **Factual Accuracy Judge** - Truth verification
4. **Prompt Faithfulness Judge** - Adherence to prompts
5. **Calibration Judge** - Uncertainty expression
6. **Bias & Fairness Judge** - Discrimination detection
7. **Reasoning Consistency Judge** - Logical coherence
8. **Discourse Coherence Judge** - Text flow
9. **Conciseness Judge** - Information density
10. **Style & Formatting Judge** - Presentation quality

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Automated Judge Creation**
- Creates all 50 judges automatically
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Updates existing judges if they exist

### 2. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Verifies all dependencies
- Tests Martian API connection
- Validates rubric loading

### 3. **Easy Management**
- List and inspect created judges
- Interactive judge details viewer
- Batch evaluation examples

### 4. **Scalable Design**
- Easy to add new LLM providers
- Easy to add new rubric types
- Configuration-driven approach

## 🔄 What Was Removed

- ❌ `bias_analyzer.py` - Complex bias analysis logic
- ❌ `experiment_runner.py` - Self-bias experiment runner
- ❌ `run_experiment.py` - Main experiment script
- ❌ `configs/` directory - Complex configuration structure
- ❌ All bias analysis and statistical testing code

## 🎉 Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Focused Purpose**: Single, clear goal of creating diverse judges
2. **Immediate Value**: Judges can be used immediately in other experiments
3. **Scalability**: Easy to extend with more providers or rubrics
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, simple codebase
5. **Reusability**: Judges can be used across multiple research projects

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

1. **Setup**: `./quick_start.sh`
2. **Test**: `python3 test_setup.py`
3. **Create**: `python3 create_judges.py`
4. **Inspect**: `python3 list_judges.py`
5. **Use**: Integrate judges into evaluation pipelines

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Add more LLM providers (e.g., Cohere, Mistral)
- Add more specialized rubrics
- Create judge performance comparison tools
- Build automated judge quality assessment
- Develop judge ensemble optimization

## 📊 Expected Output

After running `create_judges.py`, you'll have:
- **50 judges** ready for use
- **5 different LLM perspectives** on each quality dimension
- **Consistent scoring** (0.0-4.0 scale) across all judges
- **Professional descriptions** for each judge

This refactored experiment provides a solid foundation for multi-judge evaluation systems and can serve as a building block for more complex interpretability research.
